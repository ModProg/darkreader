## Building for use

You can install the extension from a file.  
Install [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/). Download the source code (or check out from git).  
Open terminal in the root folder and run:  

- `npm install`  
- `npm run build`  

This will generate a `build.zip` file that is useable in a Chromium-based browser and also a `build-firefox.xpi` file that is useable in Firefox.
